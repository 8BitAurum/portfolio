# Making a 2D Game Engine.... (and other stuff)

#### 6th August 2021

*I made a game engine*

Take a moment to let that sink in. Not many people can say *I made a game engine*. I'm not gonna keep you waiting though... so let's get into them juicy details.

### So yeah, a Game Engine

I recently joined Discord, somewhere around May (after i got into Game Development in Unity, but that's another story) where i joined the [Brackeys Discord Server](). Turns out there are a lot of people in that server with the same interests as me. I found a ton new projects ([There's even a list on languages developed by people on that server]()) some of which included game engines that people made.

When I started out in Unity, I just couldn't get any external editors to provide code completion to the Unity API (I was a beginner, so code completion was a must). I tried 5 different editors/IDEs, watched a ton of tutorials on how to fix the issue, tried suggestions and basically spent days trying to get Unity API code completion up and running (I tried Bolt during this phase but it didn't feel the same).
