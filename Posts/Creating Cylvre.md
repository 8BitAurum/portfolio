# Creating Cylvre - The JVM Language

We have all gone through this before. The itch of knowing what a programming language's internals look like. The topic ``programming-language`` yields 3600+ results, and only about 500 languages are in the mainstream (both Modern and Historic) with the rest being either unmaintained or toy languages. Most of us have just taken a subset of an existing language and made a compiler for it. Some of us have contributed to a language we like to use. Some of us have taken one step further and a language and its compiler from scratch. The greatest thing about open source is that if developers are unhappy or unsatisfied with what they see... They build their own solution. So, here is my journey on creating my solution for the whirlpool of programming languages that I was unsatisfied with. This is the story of the creation of **Cylvre** - The JVM Language.

## Driving force - What led me to create a language

It is May 2020, and we are smack in the middle of a "crisis". Time gets freed up and I decide to brush up on my coding skills because... why not? and also because I hadn't coded for like 6 months or so. Back then, I was die-hard C++ fan.
