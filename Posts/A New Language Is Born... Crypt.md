# A New Language Is Born... Say Hello to Crypt!

OK... It's been sometime since I last posted, but that's because the time was spent trying to fix an old language, getting frustrated, and creating a new one. If you are wondering what I am talking about, the old language is the one I created, called [Cylvre](https://github.com/Cylvre-Language/Cylvre). In my last post, I described how I was thrust upon the adventure that was [Creating a Programming Language](https://aurumbyte.github.io/Posts/Creating%20Cylvre), and in this post I plan on telling you how I got frustrated with the result. So... stick around if you wish to know about my suffering with Cylvre, and how I got over it to create the successor to it (somewhat), i.e. [Crypt](https://github.com/Crypt-Language/Crypt)

Turns out the compiler I "created" (copied and tweaked) had too many problems. Every fix I made resulted in a sea of NPEs. Every other NPE fix resulted in more problems.
